# Switch from CentOS to Oracle Linux

This script is designed to automatically switch a CentOS instance to Oracle Linux
by removing any CentOS-specific packages or replacing them with the Oracle Linux
equivalent.

## Supported versions

This script currently supports switching CentOS Linux 6, CentOS Linux 7 and
CentOS Linux 8. It does not support CentOS Stream.

## Before you switch

<details>
  <summary><strong>Remove all non-standard kernels</strong> i.e.  kernels that are not from either the CentOS <code>base</code> or <code>updates</code> repos. Click for more info.</summary>

  > Because of the [GRUB2 BootHole](https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/cve-2020-10713-grub2-boothole) vulnerability, our SecureBoot shim can only boot kernels signed by Oracle and we can only replace the default CentOS kernels. While this may not have an impact if SecureBoot is currently disabled, enabling it at a later date could render the system unbootable. For that reason, we strongly recommend removing all non-standard kernels before switching.

</details>

1. Ensure your CentOS `yum` or `dnf` configuration is working, i.e. there are no
   stale repositories.
1. Remove all packages from and disable all non-CentOS repositories. You can re-enable the repos and reinstall the packages them after the switch.
1. Ensure you have at least 5GB of free space in `/var/cache`.
1. All automatic updates, e.g. via `yum-cron` should be disabled.

## Usage

1. Login to your CentOS Linux 6, 7 or 8 instance as a user who has `sudo` privileges.
1. Either clone this repository or download the [`centos2ol.sh`](./centos2ol.sh) script.
1. Run `sudo bash centos2ol.sh` to switch your CentOS instance to Oracle Linux.

## Limitations

1. The script currently needs to be able communicate with the CentOS and Oracle
   Linux yum repositories either directly or via a proxy.
1. The script currently does not support instances that are registered to a
   third-party management tool like Spacewalk, Foreman or Uyuni.
1. Compatibility with packages installed from third-party repositories is
   expected but not guaranteed. Some software doesn't like the existence of an
   `/etc/oracle-release` file, for example.
1. The script only enables the base repositories required to enable switching
   to Oracle Linux. Users may need to enable additional repositories to obtain
   updates for packages already installed (see [issue #1](https://github.com/oracle/centos2ol/issues/1)).
